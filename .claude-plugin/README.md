## What's Included

This plugin provides a complete engineering workflow with four specialized skills and a sync utility:

- **Defining Issues** - Converts vague requests into precise engineering issue definitions
- **Writing Designs** - Researches industry solutions and produces a design document
- **Planning Tasks** - Translates a design into an ordered task plan with validation commands
- **Executing Tasks** - Executes a task plan exactly as written, recording outcomes
- **Syncing Linear** - Syncs issue artifacts to Linear (issue + linked documents)
